This is a sample text file for testing the Text & OCR Processor functionality in Cropio.

The Text & OCR Processor is designed to handle various file formats including:
- PDF documents with text extraction capabilities
- Microsoft Word (DOCX) documents
- Plain text files like this one
- Image files (PNG, JPG, JPEG) with OCR when Tesseract is installed

Key Features:
1. Multi-language support including Hindi, English, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese
2. Automatic language detection for OCR processing
3. Multiple output formats: Plain text, Word documents, and PDF files
4. Text processing options like noise removal and formatting preservation
5. Confidence scoring for OCR results when available

This sample file can be used to test the text processing capabilities of the system. The processor should be able to:
- Extract this text content
- Clean and format it according to user preferences
- Generate output in the selected format
- Preserve or modify formatting as requested

Testing different scenarios:
- Upload this TXT file and convert to DOCX
- Upload this TXT file and convert to PDF
- Test with different processing options enabled/disabled

The system is designed with security in mind, including file validation, malware scanning, and proper sanitization of user inputs.

Sample text in different scripts for testing:
English: Hello World
Hindi: नमस्ते दुनिया
Spanish: Hola Mundo
French: Bonjour le monde
German: Hallo Welt
Arabic: مرحبا بالعالم
Chinese: 你好世界
Japanese: こんにちは世界

This concludes the sample text file for testing purposes.
